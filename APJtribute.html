            <h3>Biography of Dr.A.PJ. Abdul Kalam</h3>
            <p>The complete name of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is Avul Pakir Jainulabudeen Abdul Kalam. He was born on 15 October 1931 t o Jainulabudeen, a Tamil Muslim boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu. His family was poor and
                he had to do assorted jobs to supplement family's income. He completed his schooling from the Schwartz Matriculation School at Ramanathapuram. He then went on to attend the Saint Joseph's College at Tiruchirappalli. He completed his graduation
                in Physics in 1954 and then moved on to Madras to study aerospace engineering.After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology (MIT-Chennai) in 1960, Kalam joined Aeronautical Development Establishment of Defence Research and Development
                Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. In1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of lndia's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed
                the Rohini satellite in near earth's orbit in July 1980. Joining ISRO was one of Kalam's biggest achievements in life. His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government
                to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. Kalam played
                a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna,
                India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. During his term as President, he was affectionately known as the People's President. </p>

            <h3>Influence</h3>
            <p>Dr.Kalam taught me how to stay simple,humble,honest,dedicated,strive for excellence and selfless love.He has inspired lots of children and the youth of our country to strive for excellence and use your education towards progress and development
                of our country.He was never after material possessions.He took with him what was his prized possession and what he valued the most: it was knowledge. No doubt in today’s evil world of politics, there existed a leader like him.That is why
                he is fondly called as”people’s president”. He earns respect even after his death.His life was very successful and I see him as my role model.
